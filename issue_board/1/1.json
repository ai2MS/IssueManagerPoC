Here's how it should be handled:\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\\n\\n1. **Issue Analysis**: The issue specifies creating a Python script that prints \\\"Hello World!\\\". This is a basic programming task with no ambiguous requirements.\\n\\n2. **Code Implementation**: The solution involves using Python's `print()` function to output the desired string.\\n\\n3. **Assigning the Task**: Assign the task to either the frontend or backend developer, depending on their availability and expertise.\\n\\n**Proposed Solution Code:**\\n\\n```python\\n# hello_world.py\\ndef display_hello_world():\\n    print(\"Hello World!\")\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"\\\"__main__\\\":\\n    display_hello_world()\\n```\n\nThis code defines a function that prints \\\"Hello World!\\\" when executed. The script can be run from the command line, and it will produce the expected output without any additional requirements.\\n\\n**Next Steps:**\\n\\n- Assign Issue #1 to either `frontend_dev` or `backend_dev`.\\n- Once assigned, the developer should implement the code as described.\\n- After implementation, mark the issue as completed in the issue tracking system.\"}", "updated_at": "2025-03-21T04:18:40.134340", "updated_by": "orchestrator", "assignee": "orchestrator"}]}
